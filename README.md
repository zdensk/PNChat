Peer-to-Peer network chat application: The program allows you to automatically discover other users within a local network.

Simple login with PIN code: A PIN code is used for user identification, which is securely stored using a hash.

Use of unique identifier and username: Each client has a local IP-based software identifier and a configurable, unique username.

Automatic peer discovery: The client sends scheduled broadcasts using the UDP protocol so that other machines on the network can find it.

Messaging via TCP: Messages between peers are transmitted using a direct TCP connection.

Dynamic peer list management: The program continuously monitors the availability of peers and only displays live clients.

Different backgrounds for sent and received messages: In the user interface, sent messages are displayed with a light gray background, and received messages are displayed with a white background.

Real-time status update: Sends a signal on the network when a peer leaves, so the offline user is automatically deleted from the list.

Store settings in a file: Securely store PIN, ID and username in a local file, which is automatically loaded after restart.

User interactions: Send text messages immediately, sound notification of incoming messages, manage login status.

Easy-to-use interface: Lists of peers and chat messages, settings fields for changing PIN and name, and sending individual messages.
